## Problem Statement
A simple note app with undo(Ctrl - z) feature implementation.

## Goals
- The user of the note app would be able to Undo and Redo actions taken.
- These actions would be stored in a Stack to enable easy access of latest user's action.

## Proposed Solution
We would implement data structures such as Stacks and Lists that would hold user's input in a stream. The user can easily Undo and Redo past actions using some defined computer keys i.e Ctrl - z. To implement an Undo feature we would pop the stack to retrieve the user's last action. The stack would be created using Linked lists

## Data Structures And Algorithms Used
- Stacks
- Lists
