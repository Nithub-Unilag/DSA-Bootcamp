## Problem Statement
A search engine that basically searches for information based on a user's input and renders the results based on relevance. 
The search engine will not too many complex features of a search engine.
<br>
<br>

## Goals 
- Figure out to collect the data from the user (as a string maybe then maybe use Tries or something)
- We won't do a web crawler of any sort, we will just use simple data that we have hard-coded in like a Hashmap, Array or Linked-List
- Based on the information collected from the user, we can decide how to search for the information from our own data.
<br>

## Proposed Solution
We will build a termainal based program that collects data from a user; we will prompt the user on what kind of stuff we have information for.
When the user inputs something that we have information for, we will just simply supply information to the user based on that. Edge cases will be handled
as well for when the information does not exist in our mini-database.
